# Pokemon Project
This project contains my code for a pokedex app I made. 

The GUI for the app is built using Tkinter. Tkinter is a GUI library for python.

I also used the PokeApi to get the pokemon data. I send requests using Python to get the JSON dataa.

There is a video file called "demo of app.mp4", please download that to view a demo video on how to use the app.

Thanks :)
