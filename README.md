# Pokemon Project
This project contains my code for a pokedex app I made. It has the code and a runnable exe file that will let you open the pokedex app.

The GUI for the app is built using Tkinter. Tkinter is a GUI library for python.

I also used the PokeApi to get the pokemon data. I send requests using Python to get the JSON dataa.
